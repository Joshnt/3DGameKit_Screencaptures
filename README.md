# üéµ Unity + FMOD Lessons

## General Concept
Learn Game-Audio in FMOD - without having to bother about integrating/ coding those connections in Unity.
With that, aspiring Game-Audio-Designers can work directly in FMOD and learn/ teach the Middleware FMOD working in a readily build game!
See setup in this Video:
*Coming Soon*



## ‚öôÔ∏è General Handling
- Open Game Build 
-  Open FMOD Session and Start Live Updates
‚û°Ô∏èThat's it!
<br> 
*Some additional notes:*
- **Loop handling:** Events with the addition "Loop" in it are actively stopped by Unity - make sure they loop inside of FMOD
- **Reload scenes**: Reload the scene via the Pause Menu (by pressing escape) when you insert a new Sound on an Event which is a loop OR when you add/ remove a spatializer on an event, so FMOD calculates those correctly.
- **Notes on events**: all events, parameters, snapshots and folders in the FMOD Project have short notes on them to explain when they are triggered  
- **Organize as you like**: Events and Snapshots can be renamed, re-colored and moved in the hierachy to match your personal preference ‚Äì parameters **cannot!!!!**

## üìö Tags & Lesson Concept
Additionally, I added Tags to all Events, by which you can filter the Events. Those include so called "Lesson-Tags", in which I tried to group the Events with increasing difficulty:
- **Lesson 1** ‚Äì No fight, no parameters (except for spaceship 3D)  
- **Lesson 2** ‚Äì Main character fight mechanics, some enemy events with 3D  
- **Lesson 3** ‚Äì Parameters for steps, hits, landings (surfaces, music, ‚Ä¶)  
- **Lesson 4** ‚Äì Detail work, environmental animations  
- **Lesson 5** ‚Äì Comparison, snapshots, mixer
